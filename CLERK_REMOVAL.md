# Clerk Authentication Removal

## Overview

Removed all Clerk authentication instances and migrated fully to NextAuth.js for
a unified authentication system.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Package Dependencies**

- ✅ Removed `@clerk/nextjs` package from dependencies
- ✅ Project now uses only NextAuth.js for authentication

### 2. **Code Changes**

#### `/src/features/users/actions/users.ts`

- Removed commented Clerk user interface types
- Clean NextAuth-only implementation

#### `/src/features/vslas/actions/vsla-monthly-data-actions.ts`

- **Before**: `import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"`
- **After**: `import { auth } from "@/features/auth/auth"`
- Updated auth checks from `const { userId } = await auth()` to
  `const session = await auth()`
- Changed authorization checks to `if (!session?.user?.id)`
- Updated `created_by` field to use `session.user.id`

#### `/src/features/activities/components/dialogs/daily-attendance-dialog.tsx`

- **Before**: `import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs"`
- **After**: `import { useSession } from "next-auth/react"`
- Changed from `const { user } = useUser()` to
  `const { data: session } = useSession()`
- Updated `recorded_by` field from `user?.emailAddresses[0]?.emailAddress` to
  `session?.user?.email`

#### `/src/lib/db/schema.ts`

- Updated comment from `// Clerk user ID` to `// User ID from auth system`

### 3. **Documentation Updates**

#### `README.md`

- Removed Clerk from tech stack section
- Removed `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` from environment variables setup
- Removed Clerk from production environment variables list

### 4. **Authentication Flow**

All authentication now flows through NextAuth.js:

- **Session Management**: NextAuth JWT strategy
- **User Identification**: Uses NextAuth session user ID
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control via NextAuth sessions
- **Database Sync**: Users stored in local database with NextAuth IDs

## Migration Notes

### For Users

No action required. The system continues to work with existing user accounts.
User IDs remain unchanged as they were already managed through the database.

### For Developers

When working with authentication:

- Use `import { auth } from "@/features/auth/auth"` for server components
- Use `import { useSession } from "next-auth/react"` for client components
- Access user data via `session.user.id` and `session.user.email`
- All authorization checks should use `session?.user?.id` pattern

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Login functionality works
- ✅ Session management works
- ✅ Role-based access control functions correctly
- ✅ User cluster assignments work
- ✅ Activity attendance recording works
- ✅ VSLA monthly data operations work
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting errors

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single authentication provider reduces
   complexity
2. **Easier Maintenance**: One system to manage and update
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer packages to maintain and update
4. **Cost Efficiency**: No additional authentication service costs
5. **Full Control**: Complete control over authentication flow and data

## Environment Variables (Updated)

Required environment variables for authentication:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Note**: `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is no longer needed and can be removed from your
`.env` file.
