# Skills Columns Enhancement - Separate Columns for Participations, Completions, and Certifications

## Overview

Enhanced the participants table to display vocational skills and soft skills
with separate columns for participations, completions, and certifications,
providing better visibility into each participant's skill progression.

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Single Vocational Skills Column

**Before**: One "Vocational Skills" column showing a summary **After**: Three
separate columns:

- **Vocational Skills - Participations**: Shows skills the participant has
  participated in
- **Vocational Skills - Completions**: Shows skills the participant has
  completed
- **Vocational Skills - Certifications**: Shows skills the participant has been
  certified in

### 2. Added Soft Skills Columns

**New columns added**:

- **Soft Skills - Participations**: Shows soft skills the participant has
  participated in
- **Soft Skills - Completions**: Shows soft skills the participant has completed
- **Soft Skills - Certifications**: Shows soft skills the participant has been
  certified in

### 3. Enhanced Business Skills Column

**Updated**: Improved the business skills column with better color coding
(emerald instead of blue)

## Color Coding System

### Vocational Skills

- **Participations**: Blue badges (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`)
- **Completions**: Green badges (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
- **Certifications**: Amber badges (`bg-amber-100 text-amber-800`)

### Soft Skills

- **Participations**: Purple badges (`bg-purple-100 text-purple-800`)
- **Completions**: Indigo badges (`bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-800`)
- **Certifications**: Cyan badges (`bg-cyan-100 text-cyan-800`)

### Business Skills

- **Has Skills**: Emerald badges (`bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800`)

## Data Display Logic

### Skill Name Truncation

- Shows up to 2 skill names separated by commas
- If more than 2 skills exist, shows "+ X more" indicator
- Maximum width of 150px with text truncation
- Full skill names shown on hover via title attribute

### Empty State Handling

- All columns show "—" (em dash) when no data exists
- Consistent styling with `text-muted-foreground text-sm`

## Technical Implementation

### Column Configuration

Each skills column includes:

- **Sortable**: `enableSorting: true`
- **Hideable**: `enableHiding: true`
- **Sortable by count**: `accessorFn` returns array length for sorting
- **Responsive design**: Text truncation and max-width constraints

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient array length calculation for sorting
- Minimal DOM elements for large datasets
- Optimized badge rendering with semantic color coding

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Clear skill progression tracking**: See exactly what stage each participant
   is at
2. **Quick visual identification**: Color-coded badges for easy scanning
3. **Detailed information**: Hover to see full skill names
4. **Sortable data**: Sort by number of skills in each category

### For Administrators

1. **Better reporting**: Separate metrics for participations vs completions vs
   certifications
2. **Progress monitoring**: Track completion rates across skill categories
3. **Resource planning**: Identify gaps in skill completion/certification
4. **Data export**: Each column can be independently exported

## Database Schema Support

Built on existing database fields:

- `vocationalSkillsParticipations` (text array)
- `vocationalSkillsCompletions` (text array)
- `vocationalSkillsCertifications` (text array)
- `softSkillsParticipations` (text array)
- `softSkillsCompletions` (text array)
- `softSkillsCertifications` (text array)
- `hasBusinessSkills` (text - "yes"/"no")

No database changes required - enhancement works with existing data structure.
