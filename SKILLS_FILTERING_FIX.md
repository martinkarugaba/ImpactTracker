# Skills Filtering Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced React Query Cache Management

- **File**: `src/features/participants/hooks/use-participants.ts`
- **Changes**: Added dedicated skills filter key to ensure React Query detects
  changes
- **Impact**: Forces cache invalidation when specific skills filters change

### 2. Improved Debug Logging

- **Files**:
  - `src/features/participants/actions/index.ts`
  - `src/features/participants/state/use-participant-container-jotai.ts`
  - `src/features/participants/components/filters/simple-filters/specific-skills-popover.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added comprehensive logging to track filter values through the
  entire data flow
- **Impact**: Helps identify where the filtering might be failing

### 3. Backend SQL Query Enhancement

- **File**: `src/features/participants/actions/index.ts`
- **Changes**: Added detailed logging for skills filters and SQL execution
- **Impact**: Shows exactly what SQL queries are being executed

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Console

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
2. Navigate to the Console tab
3. Clear the console to start fresh

### Step 3: Test Skills Filtering

1. Go to the Participants page
2. Click on the "Skills" filter button
3. Select a vocational or soft skill from the dropdown
4. Watch the console for debug messages

### Expected Console Output

You should see logs like:

```
ðŸ”§ Skills filter update: specificVocationalSkill = [skill name]
ðŸŽ¯ Active skills filters being sent to backend: {specificVocationalSkill: "[skill name]"}
ðŸš€ React Query executing getParticipants with params: ...
ðŸš€ Backend received skills filters: {specificVocationalSkill: "[skill name]"}
ðŸŽ¯ Adding specificVocationalSkill filter: [skill name]
ðŸ“‹ All applied filters: [..., "specificVocationalSkill"]
```

### Step 4: Verify Filtering Works

- The participants table should show only participants with the selected skill
- The participant count should decrease (unless all participants have that
  skill)
- Console should show the actual SQL queries being executed

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: No Skills Data in Database

**Symptoms**: Skills dropdown is empty or filtering shows no results
**Solution**: Ensure the database has participants with skills data in the
arrays

### Issue 2: React Query Not Refetching

**Symptoms**: Console shows filter changes but no new API calls **Solution**:
The enhanced query key should fix this, but may need cache invalidation

### Issue 3: SQL Query Not Working

**Symptoms**: Backend logs show filter applied but results unchanged
**Solution**: Check if skill names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. **Check Database Data**: Verify participants actually have skills in the
   arrays
2. **SQL Test**: Run manual SQL queries to test the = ANY() syntax
3. **Cache Clear**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear all caches
4. **Network Tab**: Check if new API requests are actually being made
